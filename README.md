# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project

This project includes four files: "README.md", "codebook.md", "tidyData.txt", and "run_analysis.R".

The "run_analysis.R" scripts includes the detailed explanations for each section, and have been developed to delivery the following functions:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set;
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement;
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set;
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names;
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The "tidyData.txt" is the final tindy data set generated from running the "run_analysis.R".

The "codebook.md" describes the variables within the "tidyData.txt"
